iOS Application for facilitating discussion groups around campus.

## Intention
A practice in Software Engineering concepts such as project planning and software quality, and simple iOS application development using schedulers and timers for event control.

This project was created as an exercise for writing socially conscious software. Doubling as a practice in iOS development, this project focuses on commmunication and support from peers in for college students. It allows users to discuss difficult topics, organize rsvp schedules, and provide feedback for group discussion sessions.

Standard usage case is as follows:
* User downloads the application on to their device
* They create a meeting event which is visible to all other users of the application
* Users RSVP to the event
* The event occurs, coordinated and held by a 3rd party
* Users can then post comments and feedback about discussions 
* Other users can vote up and down on discussion comments
